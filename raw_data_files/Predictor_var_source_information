Temperature:
Global temperatures were subset from ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1940 to present (Adler, et al. , 2023), accessed via Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS). All CDS datasets are assessed by the Evaluation and Quality Control (EQC) function of C3S independently of the data supplier. EQC processes ensure technical and scientific quality harmonized across all datasets, as well as check documentation for usability and reliability. One global subset was retrieved for each time period (1950-1980; 1982-2023): The first day of each month at 12:00 UTC.
